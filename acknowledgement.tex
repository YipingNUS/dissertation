First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Asst. Prof. Dr. Dittaya Wanvarie, for her guidance, suggestions, and support.

I appreciate Prof. Dr. Prabhas Chongstitvatana, Prof. Dr. Chidchanok Lursinsap, Asst. Prof. Dr. Kritsada Sriphaew, for being my thesis committee and for their useful comments to improve my work. 
 
I greatly appreciate my reporting officer, Phu Le, head of R\&D Department at Knorex, who offerd me full support to pursue M.S. study at Chulalongkorn University. I learned a lot from him not only technical experience, but more importantly leadership and inter-personal skills.

 I am grateful to my parents for their endless support and understanding. The decision to move to Thailand and to pursue a Masters' study has not been easy. But my parents are always by my side and respect my decision.

Last but not least, I would like to thank Department of Mathematics and Computer Science for the excellent program. During my time at this department, I enjoyed the classes and interaction with professors and fellow students.
